    "In the Thompson Sampling Algorithm, the priors are Beta distributions with parameters $(\\alpha_j, \\beta_j)$, and the algorithm is attempting to use sampling experiment results to modify the Beta distribution to fit the Bernoulli distribution of $\\theta_j$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is our research result:\n",
    "- The larger the order of magnitude of $K$, the smaller the $delta$.\n",
    "  - The larger the $K$ is, the closer our Beta distribution is to the Bernoulli distribution of $\\theta_j$. So experiments of TS Algorithm with larger $K$ will result in stable, relatively small deltas, like $K=1000$.\n",

    "- Although we conducted 20 experiments for a single group of $\\theta_j$ and used the average value of test results to plot, when $K$ was small, the image line still had relatively large oscillations. On the whole, the larger the $K$ is, the smaller the oscillation amplitude of the image.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the experimental results, we find that for $\\theta_j$, whether randomly selected with specific data features, the result is: the larger $K$ is, the smaller $delta$ is."
